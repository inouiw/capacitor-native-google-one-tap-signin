# Capacitor Native Sign-In with Google plugin

Wraps the native android, iOS and JavaScript Google Identity Services api for ionic capacitor apps.

### Features
- Automatically signs in returning users (unless signed out). No user action is required, but a status UI is displayed briefly, except on iOS.*
- New users can sign-up with one tap.
- After sign-out users can sign-in with one tap.
- You can attach a handler to your own custom sign-in button.


&ast; For iOS, the GoogleSignIn library stores and loads the AuthSession with idToken in the keychain until signed-out. To avoid any UI for Android and Web, you could create your own authentication cookie. To create your own auth cookie, send the Google idToken to your server, verify it, create a JWT and return it as cookie. When the user returns, just verify your JWT cookie.

This GoogleSignIn library intends to provide the best google authentication experience for each platform.

After a successful authentication, the idToken is returned as base64 and as object.

The android minSdkVersion is 24. Tested with android 10 and above.

# Install and Configure

The major version of this plugin indicates the capacitor version that it is compatible with.

#### 1. Install package

```sh
npm i --save capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin
```

See [capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin) on NPM

#### 2. Update capacitor dependencies

```sh
npx cap update
```

#### 3. Configure
Authentication is based on cryptographic keys, so you need to create a client ID for each platform in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).


- For the web platform, you need to create a client ID of type "Web application". When creating the client ID for development add two "Authorized JavaScript origins". One with URI "http://localhost:3000" and one with URI "http://localhost". "Authorized redirect URIs" is not needed. Copy the generated client ID and pass it in the `initialize` call. Note that if you host the app not on localhost or on a different port, you will either need to add more origins or add another client ID.  
If you get the error `[GSI_LOGGER]: The given origin is not allowed for the given client ID.` even though you have set the origin, you should check the headers that your server sets. Requests from the iFrame created by the google library must include the origin header. The browser will only set the header for requests from an iFrame if your server does *not* set the `Referrer-Policy` header to `same-origin`. Configure your server to not set the header. Additionally it may be needed that your server responds with a `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header value of `same-origin-allow-popups`.

- For the android platform, you need to create a client ID of type "Android", as stated in [One Tap Get started docu](https://developers.google.cn/identity/one-tap/android/get-started). You just need to create that client ID, you do not need to include it in any config. It is linked to your app via the package name and SHA-1 signing certificate fingerprint of your app. Note that usually the signing certificate for developments builds is different than for app store builds so you will need to create a client ID for development builds and one for app store builds.

- For the ios platform, you need to create a client ID of type iOS in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). Add the client ID to the  `{your-app}/ios/App/App/Info.plist` file with the key `GIDClientID` (see the demo app for reference). When creating the client ID, you will see the "iOS URL scheme" value in the Google Cloud Console. Add this also to the `Info.plist` file.

After some testing the Chrome browser may decide to block third-party sign-in prompts on localhost. In the browser console you will see the message *Third-party sign in was disabled in browser Site Settings*. Re-enable it under `chrome://settings/content/federatedIdentityApi`.

#### FAQ
- How to see and disconnect the link between your google account and your app?  
--> See [Manage connections between your Google Account and third-parties](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13533235)
- What does the warning `[GSI_LOGGER]: Your client application uses one of the Google One Tap prompt UI status methods that may stop functioning when FedCM becomes mandatory. Refer to the migration guide to update your code accordingly and opt-in to FedCM to test your changes. Learn more: https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/fedcm-migration?s=dc#display_moment and https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/fedcm-migration?s=dc#skipped_moment` mean?  
--> The warning is triggered when the `google.accounts.id.prompt` method is used with a callback argument. The message says "*may* stop functioning". The documentation states that some status methods as `isSkippedMoment()`, `isDismissedMoment()` and `getDismissedReason()` are still allowed.


# Usage
  
### Example 1: Trigger auto-sign-in and if not successful one-tap sign and show the button in parallel.
For the web platform the one-tap or FedCM prompt may not be shown with no error returned. Therefore it is recommened to always also show the button.
The button also allows the user to select an account with which she did not sign-in previously.
```TypeScript
import { GoogleOneTapAuth, SignInResultOption } from 'capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin';

void GoogleOneTapAuth.initialize({ clientId: clientId });

const onResultHandler = async (signInResultOption: SignInResultOption) => {
  if (signInResultOption.isSuccess) {
    // If the user signed-in with the button, the UI may still be shown. So close it.
    await GoogleOneTapAuth.cancelOneTapDialog();
    console.log(signInResultOption.success!);
  } else {
    console.log(signInResultOption.noSuccess!);
  }
}
// Trigger auto sign-in and if not successful try one-tap sign-in. Pass a callback.
await GoogleOneTapAuth.tryAutoOrOneTapSignInWithCallback(onResultHandler);

// Add a handler to the button shown below. Pass a callback.
await GoogleOneTapAuth.addSignInActionToExistingButtonWithCallback(
  'google-signin-existing-btn-parent', 'google-signin-existing-btn', onResultHandler);
```

```HTML
<!-- To display a nice google button, see https://github.com/inouiw/ReactSignInWithGoogleButton -->
<div id='google-signin-existing-btn-parent'>
    <button id='google-signin-existing-btn'>Custom Sign-in Button</button>
</div>
```

### Example 2: Android and iOS only.
On Android and iOS, the Google button flow, that allows the user sign-in with a different account, can be triggered via an API call.
To display a nice google button, see https://github.com/inouiw/ReactSignInWithGoogleButton
```TypeScript
import { GoogleOneTapAuth, SignInResultOption } from 'capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin';

void GoogleOneTapAuth.initialize({ clientId: clientId });

// Trigger auto sign-in and if not successful try one-tap sign-in.
let signInResultOption = await GoogleOneTapAuth.tryAutoOrOneTapSignIn();

if (signInResultOption.isSuccess === false) {
  // Start the sign-in with button flow.
  signInResultOption = await GoogleOneTapAuth.signInWithGoogleButtonFlowForNativePlatform();
}
console.log(signInResultOption);
```

```TypeScript
// See the demo folder for an example application.
```

# Run the demo app
This repository contains a demo app in the `demo/react` folder. See the README there.

# Notes about testing with an emulator

To test it using an emulator, you need to create an emulator with android play services and API version 24 or higher. See [my stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71325279/missing-featurename-auth-api-credentials-begin-sign-in-version-6/75285717#75285717). For older API levels like 24, you may need to update Chrome after creating the emulator because the plugin targets JavaScript es2017.

# Design decisions
API methods return an Option with a `isSuccess` property to specify if the operation could complete successfully. For some operations like `tryAutoSignIn` not successful can mean that the user is not currently logged into her google account. So not successful is not an exceptional case but an expected result.
To avoid that the caller needs to check `isSuccess` *and* handle exceptions, all methods will never throw an exception.


Instead of creating one signIn method with many parameters that are only used in some cases (=unclear dependencies), there are two methods with different parameters and different return types.

Parameters that are independent of a sign-in method as the clientId must be passed to `initialize`.
