# Capacitor Native Sign in with Google plugin

Wraps the native android and iOS Sign in with Google api for ionic capacitor apps. 

### Features
- Auto sign-in returning users (that you did not sign out). No user action needed but shows a status UI for a few seconds.*
- New users can sign-up with one tap.
- After sign-out users can sign-in with one tap.
- You can attach a handler to your own custom sign-in button.


&ast; To avoid any UI, you could create your own authentication cookie. Send the google idToken to your server, verify it, create a JWT and return it as cookie. When the user returns, just verify your JWT cookie.

This library intends to provide the best google authentication experience for each platform.

After a successful authentication, the idToken is returned as base64 and as object.

The android minSdkVersion is 24.

# Install and Configure

The major version of this plugin indicates the capacitor version that it is compatible with.

#### 1. Install package

```sh
npm i --save capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin
```

See [capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin) on NPM

#### 2. Update capacitor dependencies

```sh
npx cap update
```

#### 3. Configure
Authentication is based on cryptographic keys, so you need to create a client ID for each platform in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).


- For the web platform, you need to create a client ID of type "Web application". When creating the client ID for development add two "Authorized JavaScript origins". One with URI "http://localhost:3000" and one with URI "http://localhost". "Authorized redirect URIs" is not needed. Copy the generated client ID and pass it in the `initialize` call. Note that if you host the app not on localhost or on a different port, you will either need to add more origins or add another client ID.  
If you get the error `[GSI_LOGGER]: The given origin is not allowed for the given client ID.` even though you have set the origin, you should check the headers that your server sets. Requests from the iFrame created by the google library must include the origin header. The browser will only set the header for requests from an iFrame if your server does *not* set the `Referrer-Policy` header to `same-origin`. Configure your server to not set the header. Additionally it may be needed that your server responds with a `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header value of `same-origin-allow-popups`.

- For the android platform, you need to create a client ID of type "Android", as stated in [One Tap Get started docu](https://developers.google.cn/identity/one-tap/android/get-started). You just need to create that client ID, you do not need to include it in any config. It is linked to your app via the package name and SHA-1 signing certificate fingerprint of your app. Note that usually the signing certificate for developments builds is different than for app store builds so you will need to create a client ID for development builds and one for app store builds.

- For the ios platform, you need to create a client ID of type iOS in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). Add the client ID to the  `{your-app}/ios/App/App/Info.plist` file with the key `GIDClientID` (see the demo app for reference). When creating the client ID, you will see the "iOS URL scheme" value in the Google Cloud Console. Add this also to the `Info.plist` file.

# Usage

```TypeScript
import { GoogleOneTapAuth, SignInResult } from 'capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin';

await GoogleOneTapAuth.initialize({ clientId: clientId });

// Example 1: Showing the button only if auto-sign-in or one-tap sign in fail.
const signInResult = await GoogleOneTapAuth.tryAutoOrOneTapSignIn()
  .then(res => res.signInResultOptionPromise);
if (signInResult.isSuccess) {
  console.log(signInResult);
} else {Â 
  const successResult = await GoogleOneTapAuth
    .renderSignInButton('google-signin', {}, { text: 'continue_with' });
  console.log(successResult);
}

// See the demo folder for an example application.
```

```TypeScript
import { GoogleOneTapAuth, SignInResult } from 'capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin';

await GoogleOneTapAuth.initialize({ clientId: clientId });

// Example 2: Trigger auto-sign-in or one-tap sign and show the button in parallel.
const autoOrOneTapSuccessPromise = GoogleOneTapAuth.tryAutoOrOneTapSignIn()
  .then(res => res.successPromise);
const renderButtonPromise = GoogleOneTapAuth
  .renderSignInButton('google-signin', {}, { text: 'continue_with' });
const signInResultSuccess = await Promise.race([autoOrOneTapSuccessPromise, renderButtonPromise]);
console.log(signInResultSuccess);

// See the demo folder for an example application.
```

# Run the demo app
This repository contains a demo app in the `demo/react` folder. See the README there.

# Notes about testing with an emulator

To test it using an emulator, you need to create an emulator with android play services and API version 24 or higher. See [my stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71325279/missing-featurename-auth-api-credentials-begin-sign-in-version-6/75285717#75285717). For older API levels like 24, you may need to update Chrome after creating the emulator because the plugin targets JavaScript es2017.

# Design decisions
Promises will not be rejected for anticipated unsuccessful control flow. For example, if the one tap auto-login does not succeed because there is no session then this is not exceptional but expected in many cases. Rejecting the promise would mean the caller would have to catch an exception when calling `await xy` and then run follow-up code in the catch block. However when creating the demo app it was also evident that it is useful to have a promise that only resolves when authentication succeeds. Therefore the `tryAutoOrOneTapSignIn` method returns a Promise object that contains 3 properties with promises. One resolves only when authentication succeeds, the second on error and the third on success or error.

Instead of creating one signIn method with many parameters that are only used in some cases (=unclear dependencies), there are two methods with different parameters and different return types.

Parameters that are independent of a sign-in method as the clientId must be passed to `initialize`.
